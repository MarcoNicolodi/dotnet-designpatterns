# dotnet-designpatterns

GOF Design Patterns implemented in .NET Core for learning purposes.

Each pattern project is supposed to have a single pattern, so we can focus better on that command. Eg: the command project may get improvements by using it along with a factory and null object, but it would lose focus on the main pattern.

In the future i plan to have a playground for each pattern, in which we could mix pattern together to develop fun POC applications.

I also plan to have a better README for each pattern.
